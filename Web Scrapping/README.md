# Introduction to Web Scraping with Python

Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook tutorial on web scraping with Python! In this guide, I have explore the basics of web scraping using the Python programming language and two powerful libraries, namely requests for making HTTP **requests** and **BeautifulSoup** for parsing HTML content.

Web scraping is a technique used to extract information from websites. It involves sending HTTP requests to a website, retrieving the HTML content, and then parsing and extracting relevant data. This can be incredibly useful for tasks such as data collection, content aggregation, or automating repetitive tasks.

In this notebook, I have walk through a series of examples to understand how to use Python to scrape data from different websites. I have utilized the requests library to make HTTP requests and the BeautifulSoup library to parse and navigate HTML documents. The examples cover various aspects of web scraping, from accessing a website and checking response status to extracting specific elements based on HTML tags and attributes.

Before proceed with the examples, the necessary libraries installed in your Python environment by using the following commands:

**!pip install requests** </br>
**!pip install beautifulsoup4**
