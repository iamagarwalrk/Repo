# Food Panda Restaurant Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to Food Panda, a popular food delivery platform. The dataset contains information about various restaurants, including details such as budget, location (latitude and longitude), name, rating, review number, city, and main cuisine.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the characteristics of restaurants available on Food Panda. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, we aim to understand the distribution of ratings, budget levels, geographical distribution of restaurants, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of the following columns:

- **Budget:** The price range or budget for the food items.
- **Latitude and Longitude:** Geographic coordinates of the restaurant's location.
- **Name:** The name of the restaurant.
- **Rating:** The rating of the restaurant.
- **Review Number:** The number of reviews the restaurant has received.
- **City:** The city where the restaurant is located.
- **Main Cuisine:** The primary cuisine offered by the restaurant.

## Files

- **Jupyter Notebook:** The main analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`food_panda_analysis.ipynb`), where we explore the dataset and create visualizations.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used for analysis is provided in a CSV file (`your_dataset.csv`). Replace this with your actual dataset file.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```bash
