## Introduction

In this Jupyter Notebook, we explore the use of linear regression to predict the resale price of second-hand cars. The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques with TensorFlow to create an accurate predictive model. The notebook covers data preparation, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Objective

The primary objective is to showcase the implementation of linear regression using TensorFlow for predicting car prices. The project aims to provide a comprehensive example of how deep learning can be applied to real-world scenarios, specifically in the automotive industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various second-hand cars, including features such as model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant attributes. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the linear regression model.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is employed to build and train the linear regression model. Its flexibility and efficiency make it a suitable choice for deep learning applications.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The interactive computing environment facilitates code documentation, data exploration, and visualization, enhancing the overall understanding of the project.

## Getting Started
