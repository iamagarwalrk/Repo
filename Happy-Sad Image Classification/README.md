# Happy-Sad Image Classification Project


## Introduction

Welcome to this Jupyter notebook documenting my journey through the Happy-Sad Image Classification project. In this project, I aimed to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of distinguishing between happy and sad facial expressions in images. The dataset used for training and testing consists of images downloaded from Google, showcasing a variety of emotions captured in different settings.

### Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore the process of training a machine learning model for image classification. Specifically, we want to leverage deep learning techniques, utilizing a CNN architecture, to accurately classify facial expressions as either happy or sad. This task has various applications, including sentiment analysis in image data.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of happy and sad facial images sourced from Google Images. This diverse dataset allows the model to learn patterns and features associated with different emotional expressions. The images have been preprocessed and resized to ensure compatibility with the chosen CNN model architecture.

### Methodology

I adopted a systematic approach, involving data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The CNN model architecture is designed to capture hierarchical features in images, enabling it to learn distinctive patterns associated with happy and sad expressions. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters using a labeled dataset, and the performance is assessed on a separate test set.

Now, let's dive into the notebook to explore the code, visualization, and results of the Happy-Sad Image Classification project!
