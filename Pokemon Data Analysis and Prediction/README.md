# Pokemon Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to this Jupyter notebook, where we embark on an exciting journey into the captivating realm of Pokemon through the lens of data analysis. In this project, we will explore a comprehensive Pokemon dataset, unraveling the mysteries behind the various attributes that define these fantastical creatures.

**Objective:**
Our primary objective is to conduct a thorough analysis of the Pokemon dataset, gaining insights into the diverse features that contribute to a Pokemon's identity. Additionally, we'll delve into machine learning to predict whether a Pokemon is legendary or not based on its characteristics.

**Dataset:**
The dataset encompasses a variety of columns, each providing a unique perspective on a Pokemon's traits. These include the Pokemon's name, types, health points (HP), attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed, generation, and a binary indicator of whether the Pokemon is legendary.

**Project Structure:**
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Begin by loading the dataset and conducting an initial exploration to understand its structure.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Address any missing values or inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure the reliability of our analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Dive into the dataset, exploring the distribution of Pokemon types, statistical summaries, and relationships among attributes.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Investigate correlations between different stats to identify patterns and dependencies.

5. **Machine Learning: Predicting Legendary Status:**
   - Employ a decision tree classifier to predict whether a Pokemon is legendary based on its characteristics.

6. **Visualizing Results:**
   - Visualize the performance of the machine learning model using a confusion matrix and bar plots.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize key findings and insights obtained throughout the analysis.

This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide through the entire data analysis process, providing an opportunity to uncover the magic hidden within the Pokemon universe.

Let's begin our exploration of the Pokemon world and uncover the stories behind these mythical creatures!
